            <h1>न</h1>
            <p>Conceptualised and recorded in Goa, न is a celebration of the journey that the duo and the #SeedheMautNation have taken together over the past couple of years. With two albums – made in collaboration with Sez On The Beat and Ritviz – in the pipeline for 2021,  न offers a more relaxed, casual insight opportunity for fans to experience the creative and personal relationship that Calm and Encore enjoy as Seedhe Maut.</p>
